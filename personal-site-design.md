Question 1: What is you site's primary purpose?

As a student my website, "My Web Dev Wannabe" is primarily a workspace for mself to experiement, design and ultimately display learnt skills while at Bootcamp.  The website is also quickly becoming a labour of love and a source of creativity and mana. 

Question 2 : Who is your target audience?

The main audience will of course be Dev Academy staff and student peers. For assesment purposes they will need to view my website online to test and measure the skills I have learnt. My blog will hopefully become a
collection of my work and could be used to attract prospective employers in the future.


Question 3: How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? 

With great sized fonts and readble text, I want my visitors to find what they need quickly. But I would also like to grab the interest of my visitors through content and well-organized content.


Question 4: What experience would you like them to have?

My focus will placed on usability, I want visitors to be able to access the site and locate information
by way of drop boxes, buttons and links. Through vivid colours, beautiful images, clear content and well written code. 


Question 5: How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

‘Process over product’ - No one understands more than me that I may have jumped the gun. I've really reflected on how I've overstepped in Sprint 2. When I get an idea in my head and I have the time my creative mind runs away with it. It's kind of like a good book you just can't for the life of you put down.

Sprint 3 - I've leanrnt a lot about process with all the lessons about RWD, wireframes and the planning process. I may have focussed a little more on design in Sprint 2. This was mostly because having started the course with many weeks up my sleeve I felt spending more time on this sprint was good time spent. Unable to contain my excitment I have made headway into the of design my site.

Having already completed the some of Phase 1: Analysis and information gathering as stated above I have a pretty clear idea of what I think needs to be reimagined to achieve my redesign, a lot will be layout and some functions.  The site may look good, but to me everything is a work in progress. I like trying different colors graphics but I need to experiment more with code and really solidifying process.


The Design Process

Planning
-----------------
Website Structure - As my site has graphics, basic layout, fonts, drop downs, return to home buttons and spaced out content. I have re-imagined the site in the wireframes, and hope that I can deliver on the above modifications.

Design
------

Wire frame model
Visual style
Usability, UI, UX (creating interfaces for the best possible user experience)

Creating a re-imagined layout in my wire frame model, using columns, boxifying the content this time around as I did not utilize this in Sprint-2.

Would like to make some of following changes in this sprint: (if I have the time)

Focus on moulding my site into a responsive web design for better use on other devices
Remove the icon bar and maybe create a great footer instead.
Attempt a box model as I did not utilize this in the last sprint, so layout may change a bit.

Content
--------
Text content - this is very important to me, as a former freelancing ghost writer I feel its critical to ensure the grammar is correct and all flows well. I especially like to pay attention to detail, the simple fact is no- one is going to read something that is so badly written. Do I think I have achieved that? I ask myself this all the time. This is an area I would really like hone/re-think/scrutinize and constantly improve on.

Photos and Videos - The main home/index page needed to convey "My Web Dev Wannabe" so I chose the graphic to tie into that of a blogger, hence the computer and iphone in the picture. The other images were abstracts and patterns choosen so as not to interfere with or take away from but compliment the content on the page.

Testing
-------
But I will remove the icon bar and enhance the footer.
Browser compatibility - I will test this on as many browsers as I can

Deployment
---------
Monitor - This website is like a garden, I am always looking for ways to shape and improve it.
Fix bugs - I've broken, fixed this website repeatedly. This process alone is teaching about the different CSS and HTML elements, for me its been the greatest way for me to learn.


Iterate
-------

I will ensure that I iterate phases 3-7 as my sprint needs are going to change so must the features on the website.
